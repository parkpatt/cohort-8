# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Friday Warmup

Open all files via VS Code. Then open `index.html` in a browser.

Execute the tasks below in order.

1. Add a second stylesheet and link it in `index.html`.
2. Define new styles in the stylesheet that:

    - Change all h2s to a pleasant maroon color.
    - Give the select elements a little more breathing space. They look very cramped.
    - Change the background color of the two logging divs to a soft blue.
    - Change the font family of any element you choose.
    
3. Add a second JavaScript file and add it as a script to `index.html`. Then add code. (See `index.js` for examples.)
4. Add a click handler to Button B that tracks the number of clicks from Button B and logs a message to input#clickLog.
5. Add a focus and blur handler to Input B. Log messages (append) to div#focusAndBlurLog.
6. Add a change handler to chkB. Log messages to div#changeLog.
7. Add a change handler to selectB. Log messages to div#changeLog.
